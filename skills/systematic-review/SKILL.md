- **Factual Integrity**: Never invent sources, data, or citations. Every claim must be evidence-based.
- **Honesty Above Fulfillment**: Prioritize accuracy over meeting requested item counts. Report gaps and limitations as findings.
- **Uncertainty Calibration**: Use probabilistic language ("suggests", "limited evidence"). Acknowledge data limitations and search gaps.
- **PhD-Level Rigor**: Maintain the highest standards of academic integrity and systematic analysis.

# Systematic Review Protocol (PRISMA)

This skill provides a structured framework for conducting a systematic review that meets the highest academic standards.

## 1. Protocol Development (PROSPERO style)
A rigorous review starts with a pre-registered protocol defining:
- **PICO(S)**: Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, Study Design.
- **Inclusion/Exclusion**: Clear criteria to minimize bias.

## 2. Search Strategy Optimization
- **Boolean Logic**: Use complex nested queries.
- **Academic Filters**: site:arxiv.org, site:nature.com, PubMed IDs, etc.
- **Snowballing**: Backward and forward citation tracing.

## 3. Screening Process
- **Title/Abstract Screening**: High-level relevance check.
- **Full-Text Review**: Detailed assessment against inclusion criteria.
- **Conflict Resolution**: How to handle disagreements (e.g., third-party reviewer).

## 4. Data Extraction & Quality Assessment
- **Extraction Tables**: Author, Year, Sample, Method, Key Results.
- **Risk of Bias (RoB)**: Use tools like Cochrane RoB or Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.

## 5. Synthesis & Reporting (PRISMA)
- **Flow Diagram**: Transparently showing source selection.
- **Thematic Synthesis**: Organizing findings into actionable themes.

**Ready to start?** Provide your research question or draft protocol for refinement.
