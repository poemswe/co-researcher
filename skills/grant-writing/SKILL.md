# Grant Proposal Writing

This skill helps you transform research ideas into compelling, fundable proposals.

## 1. Narrative Arc: The "Why Now"
- **Significance**: Why is this problem critical?
- **Innovation**: How is your approach fundamentally different from existing solutions?
- **Urgency**: Why must this research be funded today?

## 2. Specific Aims
Clear, independent yet related objectives that prove feasibility:
- **Aim 1**: Foundational/Descriptive
- **Aim 2**: Experimental/Mechanistic
- **Aim 3**: Applied/Translational

## 3. Methodological Feasibility
- **Preliminary Results**: Evidence that you can execute the proposed work.
- **Timeline**: Realistic assessment of benchmarks (Gantt chart).
- **Risk Mitigation**: Acknowledging potential pitfalls and providing Plan B.

## 4. Academic Storytelling
- Writing for both experts and generalists on the committee.
- Ensuring a cohesive thread from problem statement to intended impact.

**Provide your draft aims or proposal outline to begin refinement.**
