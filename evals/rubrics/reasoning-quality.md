# Reasoning Quality Rubric

Evaluates the quality of reasoning, including logical coherence, bias detection accuracy, and methodology critique.

## Dimensions

### 1. Logical Coherence (0-25 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 23-25 | Arguments are valid and sound; premises clearly stated; conclusions follow necessarily; no logical gaps; complex arguments properly structured |
| 18-22 | Arguments are generally valid; minor logical gaps; conclusions well-supported; structure is clear |
| 12-17 | Some logical issues but overall coherent; occasional non-sequiturs; structure could be clearer |
| 6-11 | Significant logical gaps; conclusions don't follow from premises; confusing structure |
| 0-5 | Incoherent reasoning; multiple fallacies; conclusions unsupported; incomprehensible structure |

**Scoring Guidance:**
- Check if conclusions follow from premises
- Identify any unstated assumptions
- Verify argument structure is clear
- Look for logical fallacies (formal and informal)

**Common Fallacies to Check:**
- Ad hominem
- Straw man
- False dichotomy
- Hasty generalization
- Post hoc ergo propter hoc
- Circular reasoning
- Appeal to authority
- Slippery slope

### 2. Bias Detection Accuracy (0-25 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 23-25 | Correctly identifies all significant biases; no false positives; understands bias mechanisms; distinguishes bias from legitimate perspective |
| 18-22 | Identifies most significant biases; rare false positives; good understanding of bias types |
| 12-17 | Identifies obvious biases; misses subtle biases; some false positives; superficial analysis |
| 6-11 | Misses many biases; frequent false positives; confuses bias with disagreement |
| 0-5 | Fails to identify clear biases; or labels everything as biased; no understanding of bias concepts |

**Scoring Guidance:**

Cognitive Biases to Check:
- Confirmation bias
- Anchoring
- Availability heuristic
- Hindsight bias
- Dunning-Kruger effect

Research Biases to Check:
- Selection bias
- Publication bias
- Funding bias
- Allegiance bias
- Survivorship bias

**Distinguishing Bias from Perspective:**
- Bias: Systematic distortion affecting validity
- Perspective: Legitimate viewpoint that may be partial but not distorted

### 3. Methodology Critique Accuracy (0-25 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 23-25 | Correctly identifies methodological strengths and weaknesses; understands validity threats; appropriate for methodology type; actionable recommendations |
| 18-22 | Identifies most methodological issues; good understanding of validity; minor oversights |
| 12-17 | Identifies obvious issues; misses subtle problems; generic rather than specific critique |
| 6-11 | Misses major methodological issues; applies wrong criteria; superficial analysis |
| 0-5 | Fails to engage with methodology; incorrect assessments; no understanding of research methods |

**Scoring Guidance:**

For Quantitative Research:
- Appropriate statistical tests?
- Adequate sample size?
- Valid measures?
- Controlled confounds?
- Effect sizes reported?

For Qualitative Research:
- Appropriate methodology for question?
- Rigorous data collection?
- Systematic analysis?
- Trustworthiness strategies?
- Reflexivity addressed?

Internal Validity Threats:
- Selection, history, maturation, testing, instrumentation, regression, attrition

External Validity Threats:
- Population, ecological, temporal validity

### 4. Alternative Explanation Generation (0-25 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 23-25 | Generates multiple plausible alternatives; alternatives are genuinely competing; evidence for/against each considered; creative yet grounded |
| 18-22 | Generates good alternatives; most are plausible; some consideration of evidence |
| 12-17 | Generates some alternatives; quality varies; limited consideration of evidence |
| 6-11 | Few or implausible alternatives; fails to consider obvious alternatives |
| 0-5 | No alternatives generated; or alternatives are irrelevant/impossible |

**Scoring Guidance:**
- Are alternatives genuinely competing (could explain same data)?
- Are alternatives plausible given existing knowledge?
- Is parsimony considered (simpler explanations preferred)?
- Are alternatives specific enough to be testable?
- Is evidence for/against alternatives weighed?

## Overall Reasoning Quality Score

| Total Score | Rating | Interpretation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| 90-100 | Excellent | PhD-level critical thinking |
| 75-89 | Good | Strong reasoning with minor gaps |
| 60-74 | Acceptable | Adequate reasoning, room for improvement |
| 40-59 | Below Standard | Significant reasoning weaknesses |
| 0-39 | Unacceptable | Fails to meet reasoning standards |

## Quick Evaluation Checklist

- [ ] Are arguments logically valid?
- [ ] Do conclusions follow from evidence?
- [ ] Are biases correctly identified (no false positives/negatives)?
- [ ] Is methodology appropriately critiqued for its type?
- [ ] Are alternative explanations plausible and relevant?
- [ ] Is critical analysis balanced (not just negative)?
