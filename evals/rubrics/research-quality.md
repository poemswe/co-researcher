# Research Quality Rubric

Evaluates the quality of research outputs across source credibility, comprehensiveness, and accuracy.

## Dimensions

### 1. Source Credibility (0-25 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 23-25 | All sources are peer-reviewed or authoritative; sources are current and highly relevant; author credentials verified; publication venues are top-tier |
| 18-22 | Most sources are credible; occasional use of lower-quality sources justified; sources are relevant and reasonably current |
| 12-17 | Mix of credible and questionable sources; some sources outdated or tangentially relevant; limited verification of authority |
| 6-11 | Many questionable sources; outdated or irrelevant sources used; little attention to source authority |
| 0-5 | Primarily unreliable sources; no apparent credibility assessment; sources inappropriate for research purpose |

**Scoring Guidance:**
- Peer-reviewed > institutional > reputable journalism > blogs/opinion
- Recency matters (within 5 years for fast-moving fields)
- Domain expertise of authors should match topic
- Check for conflicts of interest

### 2. Comprehensiveness (0-25 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 23-25 | Exhaustive coverage of topic; multiple perspectives represented; includes foundational and cutting-edge work; grey literature considered where appropriate |
| 18-22 | Thorough coverage of main aspects; key perspectives included; good balance of sources; minor gaps acceptable |
| 12-17 | Adequate coverage but notable gaps; some perspectives missing; limited scope beyond obvious sources |
| 6-11 | Significant gaps in coverage; relies on few sources; major perspectives missing; superficial treatment |
| 0-5 | Minimal coverage; single source or viewpoint; critical aspects ignored; fails to address research question |

**Scoring Guidance:**
- Count unique high-quality sources (aim for 10+ for substantial reviews)
- Check for diverse source types (academic, industry, official)
- Verify key perspectives are represented
- Assess if research question is fully addressed

### 3. Accuracy (0-25 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 23-25 | All claims accurately represent sources; no misinterpretations; nuance preserved; caveats and limitations noted |
| 18-22 | Claims are accurate with minor imprecisions; sources fairly represented; most nuance captured |
| 12-17 | Generally accurate but some misrepresentations; over-simplification of complex findings; some caveats missing |
| 6-11 | Noticeable inaccuracies; sources misquoted or misrepresented; important nuances lost; misleading summaries |
| 0-5 | Serious inaccuracies; fabricated or distorted claims; sources fundamentally misrepresented |

**Scoring Guidance:**
- Verify key claims against original sources
- Check for cherry-picking or selective quotation
- Assess whether uncertainty is appropriately conveyed
- Look for over-generalization from limited evidence

### 4. Citation Quality (0-25 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 23-25 | All sources properly cited; format consistent and correct; DOIs/URLs provided; page numbers where applicable; enables source verification |
| 18-22 | Most sources properly cited; minor formatting inconsistencies; sources are traceable |
| 12-17 | Citations present but incomplete; some formatting errors; occasional difficulty tracing sources |
| 6-11 | Many missing or incomplete citations; inconsistent format; sources hard to verify |
| 0-5 | Minimal or no citations; sources untraceable; potential plagiarism concerns |

**Scoring Guidance:**
- Check citation completeness (authors, title, venue, date, DOI/URL)
- Verify format consistency within document
- Confirm sources are traceable
- Check in-text citations match reference list

## Overall Research Quality Score

| Total Score | Rating | Interpretation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| 90-100 | Excellent | PhD-level quality; publishable |
| 75-89 | Good | Strong research with minor issues |
| 60-74 | Acceptable | Adequate but needs improvement |
| 40-59 | Below Standard | Significant quality concerns |
| 0-39 | Unacceptable | Fails to meet research standards |

## Quick Evaluation Checklist

- [ ] Are sources appropriate for the research question?
- [ ] Are sources sufficiently credible and current?
- [ ] Is coverage comprehensive across perspectives?
- [ ] Are claims accurately representing sources?
