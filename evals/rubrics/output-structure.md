# Output Structure Rubric

Evaluates the quality of output format, organization, and communication.

## Dimensions

### 1. Organization (0-25 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 23-25 | Logical flow throughout; clear hierarchy; sections build on each other; easy to navigate; appropriate use of headings/subheadings |
| 18-22 | Good organization; minor flow issues; clear structure; easy to follow |
| 12-17 | Adequate organization; some sections out of place; structure present but could be improved |
| 6-11 | Poor organization; hard to follow; unclear structure; sections seem random |
| 0-5 | No discernible organization; chaotic presentation; impossible to navigate |

**Scoring Guidance:**
- Does the document have a clear beginning, middle, and end?
- Are sections logically ordered?
- Is there a clear hierarchy (headings, subheadings)?
- Can a reader quickly find specific information?
- Does each section serve a clear purpose?

### 2. Completeness (0-25 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 23-25 | All required elements present; nothing essential missing; appropriate depth for each section; executive summary if lengthy |
| 18-22 | Most elements present; minor omissions; good depth overall |
| 12-17 | Key elements present but some gaps; uneven depth across sections |
| 6-11 | Missing important elements; incomplete sections; inadequate depth |
| 0-5 | Major elements missing; severely incomplete; fails to address purpose |

**Required Elements by Output Type:**

Literature Review:
- [ ] Research question
- [ ] Search methodology
- [ ] Source summary
- [ ] Thematic analysis
- [ ] Gap identification
- [ ] References

Critical Analysis:
- [ ] Claim identification
- [ ] Evidence assessment
- [ ] Logical analysis
- [ ] Bias detection
- [ ] Alternative explanations
- [ ] Overall assessment

Hypothesis Development:
- [ ] Research question
- [ ] Null and alternative hypotheses
- [ ] Variable mapping
- [ ] Predictions
- [ ] Design recommendation
- [ ] Falsifiability statement

Research Synthesis:
- [ ] Executive summary
- [ ] Key findings
- [ ] Confidence levels
- [ ] Contradictions addressed
- [ ] Limitations
- [ ] Conclusions

### 3. Clarity (0-25 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 23-25 | Crystal clear writing; accessible to target audience; technical terms defined; no ambiguity; concise yet complete |
| 18-22 | Clear writing; mostly accessible; rare ambiguity; good balance of detail |
| 12-17 | Generally clear; some sections confusing; occasional jargon without explanation |
| 6-11 | Often unclear; excessive jargon; ambiguous statements; hard to understand |
| 0-5 | Incomprehensible; impenetrable jargon; pervasive ambiguity |

**Scoring Guidance:**
- Is the writing accessible to the intended audience?
- Are technical terms defined when first used?
- Are sentences clear and unambiguous?
- Is the length appropriate (not too verbose or too terse)?
- Are complex ideas explained effectively?

### 4. Visual Communication (0-25 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 23-25 | Excellent use of tables, lists, and formatting; visuals enhance understanding; consistent styling; appropriate whitespace |
| 18-22 | Good use of visual elements; formatting aids comprehension; mostly consistent |
| 12-17 | Some visual elements; could use more structure; inconsistent formatting |
| 6-11 | Minimal visual structure; wall of text; poor formatting |
| 0-5 | No visual structure; unreadable formatting; visual elements confuse rather than clarify |

**Scoring Guidance:**

Effective Visual Elements:
- Tables for comparisons and structured data
- Bullet lists for enumeration
- Numbered lists for sequences
- Bold/italic for emphasis (sparingly)
- Headings for organization
- Code blocks for technical content

Visual Best Practices:
- Consistent heading hierarchy
- Appropriate whitespace
- Tables have clear headers
- Lists are parallel in structure
- Visual elements serve a purpose

## Overall Output Structure Score

| Total Score | Rating | Interpretation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| 90-100 | Excellent | Professional, publication-ready |
| 75-89 | Good | Well-structured, minor improvements possible |
| 60-74 | Acceptable | Functional but needs polish |
| 40-59 | Below Standard | Significant structural issues |
| 0-39 | Unacceptable | Fails communication standards |

## Quick Evaluation Checklist

- [ ] Is there a clear logical flow?
- [ ] Are all required elements present?
- [ ] Is the writing clear and accessible?
- [ ] Are visual elements (tables, lists) used effectively?
- [ ] Is formatting consistent throughout?
