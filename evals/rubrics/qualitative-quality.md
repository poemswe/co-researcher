# Qualitative Quality Rubric

Evaluates qualitative research methods, coding rigor, and thematic analysis.

## Overview

This rubric assesses an agent's ability to conduct systematic qualitative analysis, develop coherent themes, and maintain methodological rigor without quantitative methods.

**Use for**: Thematic analysis, coding strategy, grounded theory, discourse analysis, interview protocol development.

**Do NOT use for**: Quantitative analysis, statistical testing, literature reviews.

## Dimensions

### 1. Coding Rigor (0-30 points)

Evaluates systematic and transparent coding process.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 28-30 | Explicit coding scheme; codes defined with examples; systematic application; inter-rater reliability considered; reflexivity evident; audit trail clear |
| 22-27 | Clear coding scheme; codes mostly defined; systematic process; some reflexivity; adequate documentation |
| 16-21 | Basic coding scheme; codes somewhat defined; process less systematic; limited reflexivity; gaps in documentation |
| 9-15 | Ad-hoc coding; codes poorly defined; unsystematic; no reflexivity; poor documentation |
| 0-8 | No systematic coding; arbitrary labels; opaque process; no documentation |

**Scoring Guidance**:
- Braun & Clarke's 6-phase model: Check for familiarization, code generation, theme search, review, definition, write-up
- Codes should be clearly defined with inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Examples from data should illustrate each code
- Process should be replicable by another researcher

### 2. Theme Development (0-30 points)

Evaluates coherence, grounding, and depth of identified themes.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 28-30 | Themes are coherent, distinct, and well-bounded; strongly grounded in data with multiple quotes; captures complexity; hierarchical structure clear; semantic and latent meanings addressed |
| 22-27 | Themes mostly coherent and distinct; adequately grounded in data; some complexity captured; structure apparent |
| 16-21 | Themes somewhat coherent but overlap exists; grounded but limited quotes; surface-level analysis; weak structure |
| 9-15 | Themes overlap significantly or disconnected; weakly grounded; superficial; no clear structure |
| 0-8 | Themes are researcher impressions, not data-driven; no grounding; no depth |

**Scoring Guidance**:
- Themes should "say something" about the research question
- Each theme should be supported by multiple data extracts
- Quotes should illustrate, not just prove existence
- Semantic themes: explicit meanings in data
- Latent themes: underlying ideas/concepts

### 3. Trustworthiness (0-20 points)

Evaluates qualitative rigor using Lincoln & Guba's criteria.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 19-20 | Multiple trustworthiness strategies used; triangulation evident; member checking mentioned; researcher reflexivity demonstrated; negative case analysis included; thick description provided |
| 15-18 | Several strategies used; some triangulation; researcher position discussed; adequate description |
| 11-14 | Basic strategies; limited triangulation; minimal reflexivity; thin description |
| 6-10 | Minimal strategies; no triangulation; no reflexivity; inadequate description |
| 0-5 | No attention to trustworthiness; no rigor strategies |

**Scoring Guidance**:
- **Credibility**: Triangulation, member checking, peer debriefing
- **Transferability**: Thick description, purposive sampling
- **Dependability**: Audit trail, clear methodology
- **Confirmability**: Reflexivity, negative case analysis

### 4. Theoretical Saturation (0-20 points)

Evaluates adequacy of data depth and conceptual development.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 19-20 | Clear evidence of saturation; new data not producing new codes; concepts fully developed; relationships between themes explored; theoretical integration evident |
| 15-18 | Saturation likely; concepts well-developed; some theme relationships; adequate theoretical development |
| 11-14 | Saturation uncertain; concepts partially developed; theme relationships unclear; limited theory |
| 6-10 | Unlikely saturation; thin concepts; no theme relationships; descriptive only |
| 0-5 | No saturation; superficial concepts; list of themes without integration |

**Scoring Guidance**:
- Saturation: No new codes emerging from additional data
- Conceptual depth: Themes are well-defined with properties and dimensions
- Theoretical integration: Themes relate to each other and larger theory
- Not just descriptive: Moves beyond "what" to "how" and "why"

## Overall Qualitative Quality Score

| Total Score | Rating | Interpretation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| 90-100 | Excellent | Publishable qualitative research |
| 75-89 | Good | Solid analysis with minor gaps |
| 60-74 | Acceptable | Adequate but lacks depth |
| 40-59 | Below Standard | Superficial or ad-hoc analysis |
| 0-39 | Unacceptable | Not systematic qualitative research |

## Quick Evaluation Checklist

- [ ] Is there a clear, systematic coding process?
- [ ] Are codes defined with examples?
- [ ] Are themes coherent and distinct?
- [ ] Are themes grounded in data with quotes?
- [ ] Is researcher reflexivity evident?
- [ ] Are trustworthiness strategies used?
- [ ] Is saturation addressed or evident?
- [ ] Does analysis move beyond description to interpretation?

## Examples

### High Score (92/100)
*Task: Analyze interview transcripts about remote work experiences*

**Agent Output**:
- **Coding (29/30)**: 47 initial codes systematically applied; coding table with definitions and examples; iterative refinement described; reflexivity note about researcher's own remote work bias
- **Themes (28/30)**: 4 themes (autonomy paradox, visibility anxiety, boundary dissolution, community reimagination); each with 5-8 supporting quotes; semantic and latent meanings; hierarchical structure with sub-themes
- **Trustworthiness (18/20)**: Triangulation across 3 job types; member checking with 5 participants; thick description of context; reflexivity statement; audit trail in appendix
- **Saturation (17/20)**: Notes saturation after interview 18 of 23; demonstrates with analysis of last 5 interviews showing no new codes; theme properties fully developed

### Low Score (42/100)
*Same task*

**Agent Output**:
- **Coding (12/30)**: Lists 12 broad categories without clear definitions; no examples; process unclear
- **Themes (14/30)**: 3 vague themes ("challenges," "benefits," "mixed feelings"); 1-2 quotes each; no depth; overlapping
- **Trustworthiness (6/20)**: No triangulation; no reflexivity; no member checking; thin description
- **Saturation (10/20)**: No discussion of saturation; concepts underdeveloped; descriptive list of points

## Special Cases

### Grounded Theory
- **Additional criteria**: Theoretical sampling, constant comparison, memo-writing
- **Saturation**: Higher bar (theoretical saturation, not just code saturation)
- **Integration**: Core category should integrate all themes

### Discourse Analysis
- **Coding**: Focus on linguistic features, discursive strategies
- **Themes**: Interpretative repertoires, subject positions
- **Context**: Power relations, ideological underpinnings required

### Phenomenology
- **Coding**: Horizonalization, clustering into meaning units
- **Themes**: Essential structures of experience
- **Reflexivity**: Bracketing/epoché critical
