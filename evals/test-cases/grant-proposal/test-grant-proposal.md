# Test Case: Grant Proposal Structure (Grant Writer)

## Metadata
- **Agent**: grant-proposal
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Area**: Grant Development

## Rubric Profile
- **Primary**: design-quality (50%)
- **Secondary**: analytical-quality (30%)
- **Tertiary**: output-structure (20%)

## Task Prompt

```
I have a research idea about using AI to predict wildfires before they spread. I want to apply for an NSF grant. Can you help me structure a proposal?

My preliminary work: I have a prototype CNN model trained on satellite imagery that can detect smoke patterns with 75% accuracy on a small dataset (1000 images from California 2020-2022).
```

## Expected Behaviors

### Must Include
- [ ] Identify Significance: Explain why wildfire prediction is a critical societal problem.
- [ ] Propose Specific Aims: At least 2-3 clear, independent objectives (e.g., Aim 1: Expand dataset, Aim 2: Improve model, Aim 3: Deploy in partnership).
- [ ] Address Feasibility: Note that 75% accuracy and 1000 images is a solid start but needs expansion.
- [ ] Mention NSF: Reference NSF priorities or program areas (e.g., CPS, AI, environmental).

### Should Include
- [ ] Timeline: Suggest a realistic multi-year plan
- [ ] Risk Mitigation: Identify potential risks (e.g., data availability, model generalization)
- [ ] Broader Impacts: Discuss societal benefits beyond the research itself
- [ ] Collaboration: Suggest partnerships (fire agencies, other universities)

### Should Not Include
- [ ] Overpromising results without acknowledging limitations
- [ ] Ignoring the preliminary data limitations
- [ ] Generic advice that doesn't relate to the specific topic

## Evaluation Criteria

### Design Quality (Primary)
- Aims Structure: Clear, independent, synergistic objectives
- Narrative Arc: Significance → Innovation → Urgency flow

### Analytical Quality
- Feasibility Assessment: Realistic expectations for timeline and resources
- Risk Identification: Acknowledging and addressing pitfalls

### Output Structure
- Professional grant proposal format
- Clear section organization

## Passing Threshold
- Overall Score: >= 70/100
