# Test Case: Thematic Analysis

## Metadata

- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Focus**: Conducting thematic analysis on text data

## Rubric Profile
- **Primary**: qualitative-quality (75%)
- **Secondary**: output-structure (25%)
- **Timeout**: 900

## Task Prompt

```
Analyze these interview excerpts from employees about remote work and identify themes:

P1: "I love the flexibility. I can pick up my kids from school now. But sometimes I miss
the random chats by the coffee machine."

P2: "My productivity has skyrocketed. No more commute means I start fresh. But I do
feel isolated sometimes, especially during long projects."

P3: "The boundary between work and home has blurred. I find myself checking email at 10pm.
But I wouldn't go back - the autonomy is worth it."

P4: "Video calls are exhausting. Back-to-back Zoom meetings drain me more than in-person.
Yet overall, I have more control over my schedule."

P5: "I worry about my career progression. Out of sight, out of mind? But honestly,
I'm delivering better work than ever."

Conduct a thematic analysis and present the findings.
