# Test Case: First Principles Reasoning

## Metadata
- **Agent**: lateral-thinker
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Focus**: Breaking down problems to fundamental truths

## Task Prompt

```
Everyone says you need a college degree to get a good job.
Apply first principles thinking to challenge this assumption.
What are the fundamental truths here, and what might we be getting wrong?
```

## Expected Behaviors

### Must Include
- [ ] Identification of the core assumption
- [ ] Decomposition into fundamental components
- [ ] Distinction between real constraints and assumed ones
- [ ] Reconstruction of alternatives from fundamentals
- [ ] Evidence/reasoning for each step

### Expected Decomposition
- What does "good job" actually mean? (income, satisfaction, growth, status)
- What does a degree actually provide? (knowledge, credential, network, signal)
- What do employers actually need? (skills, reliability, culture fit)
- What are alternatives for each component?

### Should Include
- [ ] Historical context (degree wasn't always required)
- [ ] Counter-examples (successful people without degrees)
- [ ] Economic/signaling theory perspective
- [ ] Practical alternatives identified
- [ ] Nuance (when degrees do matter)

### Should Not Include
- [ ] Simply arguing "degrees are useless"
- [ ] Missing the fundamental decomposition
- [ ] Accepting assumption without challenge
- [ ] Ignoring valid reasons for degree requirements

## Evaluation Criteria

### Reasoning Quality (Primary)
- Logical Coherence: Is decomposition logical?
- Alternative Explanations: Are assumptions challenged?
- Methodology Critique: Are constraints properly analyzed?

### Research Quality
- Accuracy: Are fundamental truths actually true?

### Output Structure
- Clear decomposition steps
- Reconstruction from fundamentals
- Balanced conclusion

## Passing Threshold
- Overall Score: ≥ 70/100
- Must demonstrate actual first principles decomposition

## Rubric Weights
- Research Quality: 20%
- Reasoning Quality: 55%
- Output Structure: 25%
