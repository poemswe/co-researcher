# Test Case: Mixed Methods Design & Integration

## Metadata
- **Agent**: research-methodology
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Focus**: Designing integrated mixed-methods studies with clear qual-quant integration

## Rubric Profile
- **Primary**: design-quality (75%)
- **Secondary**: analytical-quality (25%)
- **Timeout**: 900

## Task Prompt

```
We want to evaluate the effectiveness of a new workplace wellness program.
We need to know:
1. Does it work? (Does employee health/stress improve?)
2. How does it work? (What aspects resonate with employees?)
3. For whom does it work? (Are there subgroups who benefit more?)

We have 200 employees and 3 months to study. What's the best research design?
```

## Expected Behaviors

### Must Include
- [ ] Recognition that this requires mixed methods (both qual and quant)
- [ ] Clear mixed methods design type (sequential or concurrent)
- [ ] Quantitative component: specific metrics and analysis approach
- [ ] Qualitative component: specific method and sample
- [ ] Integration point: how qual and quant combine to answer RQ
- [ ] Timeline showing phase sequencing or parallelization

### Should Include
- [ ] Justification for mixed methods (why not just one?)
- [ ] Discussion of weighting between qual/quant
- [ ] Sampling strategy for both components
- [ ] Measurement instruments (validated scales for quantitative)
- [ ] Qualitative sampling approach (purposive, stratified?)
- [ ] Quality criteria for both components (GRADE/CONSORT for quant, CASP for qual)
- [ ] Discussion of how contradictions will be addressed
- [ ] Feasibility assessment (3 months, N=200)

### Should Not Include
- [ ] Pure quantitative design (insufficient for mechanism understanding)
- [ ] Undefined mixed methods (just saying "use both")
- [ ] Missing integration strategy
- [ ] Unrealistic sampling (e.g., qualitative interviews with all 200)
- [ ] Ignoring temporal constraints (3 months)
- [ ] Generic quality criteria without mixed methods specificity

## Evaluation Criteria

### Design Quality (Primary)
- **Methodology Fit**: Mixed methods justified by research questions?
- **Design Clarity**: Is the design (Sequential Explanatory? Convergent?) explicitly named?
- **Integration Strategy**: How will qual/quant results combine?
- **Feasibility**: Realistic timeline and participant burden?

### Analytical Quality (Secondary)
- **Reasoning**: Why this mixed design vs alternatives?
- **Component Specificity**: Are qual and quant aspects fully specified?
- **Trade-off Discussion**: What is gained/lost by mixing methods?

### Expected Design
**Most appropriate**: Sequential Explanatory (Quantitative → Qualitative)
- Quant Phase: Survey N=200 on wellness outcomes, stress, engagement
- Qual Phase: Interviews N=20-30 (purposive sampling from survey responders, stratified by benefit level)
- Integration: Use quantitative findings to identify variation, then explore mechanisms qualitatively

**Alternative**: Convergent Parallel (both simultaneous, combined at interpretation)
- Could work but tight timeline makes sequential more feasible

**Not appropriate**: Purely quantitative or purely qualitative for this set of questions

## Passing Threshold
- Overall Score: ≥ 70/100
- Design Quality: ≥ 75/100
- Must specify mixed methods design type
- Must detail both qual and quant components
- Must explain integration point
- Must address all 3 research questions explicitly
