# Test Case: Research Gap Identification

## Metadata
- **Agent**: literature-review
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Focus**: Gap analysis and synthesis

## Rubric Profile
- **Primary**: research-quality (70%)
- **Secondary**: analytical-quality (20%)
- **Tertiary**: output-structure (10%)

## Task Prompt

```
Conduct a literature review on AI-assisted medical diagnosis and identify research gaps.
I want to understand what's been studied and what areas need more research.
```

## Expected Behaviors

### Must Include
- [ ] Identifies at least 3 distinct research gaps
- [ ] Provides evidence for why each gap exists
- [ ] Synthesizes findings across sources
- [ ] Distinguishes well-studied from under-studied areas
- [ ] Maps the research landscape

### Should Include
- [ ] Gaps categorized by type (methodological, population, theoretical)
- [ ] Suggestions for future research directions
- [ ] Chronological evolution of the field
- [ ] Key debates or disagreements noted
- [ ] Intersection of AI and medical domains addressed

### Should Not Include
- [ ] Gaps without evidence
- [ ] Gaps that have already been addressed
- [ ] Speculative gaps without literature support
- [ ] Confusion between gaps and limitations

## Evaluation Criteria

### Research Quality (Primary)
- Comprehensiveness: Has the landscape been adequately mapped?
- Accuracy: Are gaps accurately identified?
- Citation Quality: Is evidence for gaps cited?

### Reasoning Quality (Primary)
- Logical Coherence: Does gap identification follow from evidence?
- Alternative Explanations: Are multiple interpretations considered?

### Output Structure
- Clear gap enumeration
- Evidence linked to each gap
- Actionable research directions

## Passing Threshold
- Overall Score: ≥ 70/100
- Both Research and Reasoning Quality: ≥ 70/100
