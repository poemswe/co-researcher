# Test Case: Hypothesis Formulation

## Metadata
- **Agent**: hypothesis-explorer
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Focus**: Converting research questions to testable hypotheses

## Task Prompt

```
I've observed that my team seems more productive when working from home,
but some team members prefer the office. I want to study this properly.

Help me formulate testable hypotheses about work location and productivity.
```

## Expected Behaviors

### Must Include
- [ ] Null hypothesis (H₀) clearly stated
- [ ] Alternative hypothesis (H₁) clearly stated
- [ ] Variables identified (IV, DV)
- [ ] Operationalization of "productivity"
- [ ] Specific, testable predictions

### Should Include
- [ ] Multiple hypothesis formulations (different angles)
- [ ] Consideration of moderating variables (role, personality)
- [ ] PICO or similar framework applied
- [ ] Falsifiability explicitly addressed
- [ ] Potential confounds identified

### Should Not Include
- [ ] Unfalsifiable hypotheses
- [ ] Vague, untestable predictions
- [ ] Missing operational definitions
- [ ] Assumptions presented as hypotheses

## Evaluation Criteria

### Reasoning Quality (Primary)
- Logical Coherence: Are hypotheses well-formed?
- Alternative Explanations: Are confounds considered?

### Research Quality
- Accuracy: Are hypothesis components correct?
- Comprehensiveness: Are key variables covered?

### Output Structure
- Clear hypothesis statements
- Variable mapping table
- Predictions enumerated

## Passing Threshold
- Overall Score: ≥ 70/100
- Reasoning Quality: ≥ 75/100
- Must include valid H₀ and H₁

## Rubric Weights
- Research Quality: 30%
- Reasoning Quality: 45%
- Output Structure: 25%
