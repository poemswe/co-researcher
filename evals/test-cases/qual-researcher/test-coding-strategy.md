# Test Case: Coding Strategy Development

## Metadata
- **Agent**: qual-researcher
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Focus**: Developing coding schemes for qualitative data

## Task Prompt

```
I'm studying how users describe their frustrations with mobile apps.
I have 50 app store reviews expressing dissatisfaction.

Help me develop a coding strategy and initial codebook for analyzing this data.
What codes should I use? How should I approach the coding process?
```

## Expected Behaviors

### Must Include
- [ ] Coding strategy recommendation (open, axial, or combined)
- [ ] Initial code categories
- [ ] Code definitions
- [ ] Coding process steps
- [ ] Example applications

### Expected Code Categories
- Functional issues (bugs, crashes, errors)
- Usability issues (confusing UI, hard to navigate)
- Performance issues (slow, battery drain)
- Content issues (missing features, poor content)
- Value issues (not worth price, ads)
- Support issues (poor customer service)

### Should Include
- [ ] Hierarchy (codes and subcodes)
- [ ] Inclusion/exclusion criteria for each code
- [ ] Process for handling ambiguous cases
- [ ] Iterative refinement approach
- [ ] Inter-coder reliability considerations

### Should Not Include
- [ ] Codes without clear definitions
- [ ] Overlapping codes without guidance
- [ ] Overly granular or overly broad codes
- [ ] Missing obvious categories

## Evaluation Criteria

### Reasoning Quality (Primary)
- Logical Coherence: Is the coding strategy coherent?
- Methodology Critique: Are qualitative methods correctly applied?

### Research Quality
- Comprehensiveness: Are key categories covered?

### Output Structure
- Clear codebook format
- Usable definitions
- Process documentation

## Passing Threshold
- Overall Score: ≥ 70/100
- Must provide usable codebook structure

## Rubric Weights
- Research Quality: 30%
- Reasoning Quality: 45%
- Output Structure: 25%
