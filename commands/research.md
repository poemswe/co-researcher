# /research - Start Research Project

I'll help you launch a systematic research project. Let's define the scope and approach.

{% if $ARGUMENTS %}
## Research Topic
Starting research on: **$ARGUMENTS**

Now let me help refine your question and create a research plan.
{% else %}
## What I need from you:

1. **Topic**: What are you researching?
2. **Question**: What specific question do you want to answer?
3. **Purpose**: What will this research inform (decision, paper, understanding)?
{% endif %}

## What I'll do:

1. Help refine your research question
2. Identify appropriate methodology (literature review, investigation, hypothesis testing)
3. Create a research plan with clear phases
4. Deploy specialized agents as needed:
   - Literature Reviewer for academic sources
   - Critical Analyzer for evidence evaluation
   - Hypothesis Explorer for testable questions
   - Quant/Qual Analysts for methodology
   - Lateral Thinker for creative approaches

## Research Types I Support:

| Type | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **Literature Review** | Understanding existing knowledge |
| **Investigation** | Fact-finding, verification |
| **Hypothesis Testing** | Scientific inquiry |
| **Synthesis** | Integrating multiple sources |
| **Critical Analysis** | Evaluating claims/arguments |

Let's start. What would you like to research?
