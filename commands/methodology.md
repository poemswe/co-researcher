# /methodology - Methodological Guidance

{% if $ARGUMENTS %}
I'll provide PhD-level methodological guidance for: **$ARGUMENTS**
{% else %}
I'll help you select and design the right methodology for your research.
{% endif %}

## What I'll do:

### Question Classification
- Identify research question type (exploratory, descriptive, comparative, causal, etc.)
- Map to appropriate methodology family

### Methodology Recommendations
- Present 2-3 candidate approaches with trade-offs
- Discuss quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods options
- Compare strengths and limitations

### Design Specification
- Detail study design, sampling strategy, data collection
- Specify analysis approach and quality standards
- Provide discipline-specific guidance (psychology, medicine, sociology, etc.)

### Validity Assessment
- Identify threats to internal and external validity
- Suggest mitigation strategies
- Address feasibility and timeline considerations

## What I need:

{% if not $ARGUMENTS %}
Please provide:
1. **Research Question**: What are you trying to understand or test?
2. **Context**: Target population, discipline, constraints
3. **Goals**: Generalization, depth, causal claims, theory-building?
{% else %}
Ready to analyze. Provide additional context if needed:
- Target population or context
- Discipline or field
- Any specific constraints
{% endif %}

## Output:

You'll receive:
- Research question classification with reasoning
- 2-3 candidate methodologies with pros/cons
- Recommended approach with full justification
- Design specification (participants, data collection, analysis)
- Validity threats and mitigation strategies
- Realistic timeline and feasibility assessment
- Methodological limitations acknowledged

What is your research question?
