# /synthesize - Research Synthesis

I'll integrate findings from multiple sources into coherent, actionable conclusions.

## What I'll do:

### Pattern Recognition
- Identify convergent findings
- Flag contradictions
- Map evidence strength

### Weight Assignment
- Assess source quality
- Apply evidence hierarchy
- Calculate confidence levels

### Contradiction Resolution
- Identify genuine disagreements
- Assess relative credibility
- Propose resolutions

### Narrative Construction
- Organize thematically
- Build logical flow
- Connect pieces coherently

### Uncertainty Quantification
- Classify confidence levels
- Acknowledge limitations
- Use calibrated language

## What I need:

Provide:
- Multiple sources to synthesize, OR
- Research question with context, OR
- Findings from previous research phases

## Output:

You'll receive:
- Executive summary
- Key findings with confidence levels
- Areas of uncertainty
- Contradictions and interpretations
- Integrated conclusions
- Implications for different audiences
- Research gaps identified

What would you like me to synthesize?
