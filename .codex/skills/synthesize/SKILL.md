# /synthesize - Research Synthesis

I'll integrate findings on **$ARGUMENTS** into coherent, actionable conclusions.

## What I'll do:
1. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify convergence, flag contradictions
2. **Weight Assignment**: Assess source quality, apply evidence hierarchy
3. **Contradiction Resolution**: Resolve disagreements between sources
4. **Narrative Construction**: Build logical flow and organization
5. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Classify confidence levels

Provide your sources, research question, or findings to synthesize.
