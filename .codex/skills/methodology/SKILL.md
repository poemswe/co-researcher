# /methodology - Methodological Guidance

I provide PhD-level guidance on research methodology, helping you select and design the right approach for your research.

## What I need from you:
Please provide:
1. **Research Question**: What are you trying to understand or test?
2. **Context**: Target population, discipline, or field
3. **Goals**: Generalization, depth, causal claims, theory-building?

## What I'll do:
1. **Question Classification**: Identify research question type and appropriate methodology family
2. **Methodology Recommendations**: Present 2-3 candidate approaches with trade-offs
3. **Design Specification**: Detail study design, sampling, data collection, and analysis
4. **Validity Assessment**: Identify threats and mitigation strategies
5. **Feasibility Review**: Realistic timeline and resource requirements

## My Guidance Covers:
- Quantitative methods (RCT, quasi-experimental, observational, surveys)
- Qualitative methods (phenomenology, grounded theory, thematic analysis, ethnography, narrative, case study)
- Mixed methods (sequential exploratory, explanatory, convergent parallel, embedded)
- Discipline-specific standards (psychology, medicine, sociology, education)
- Methodology validation (quality criteria, rigor standards)

Let's begin. What is your research question?
