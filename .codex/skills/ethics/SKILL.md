# /ethics - Ethical Analysis

I'll evaluate the ethical considerations and risks of your research design.

## What I'll analyze:
1. **Participant Protection**: Informed consent, risk-benefit
2. **Data Privacy**: Anonymization, lifecycle, regulation (GDPR/HIPAA)
3. **Algorithmic Bias**: Social impact and fairness
4. **Compliance**: IRB readiness and international standards

Provide your project description or research design.
