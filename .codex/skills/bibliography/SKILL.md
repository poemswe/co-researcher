# /bibliography - Citation Management

I'll help generate properly formatted citations and bibliographies.

## Supported Styles:

| Style | Common Use |
|-------|------------|
| **APA 7th** | Psychology, social sciences, education |
| **MLA 9th** | Humanities, literature, arts |
| **Chicago** | History, some humanities |
| **IEEE** | Engineering, computer science |
| **Harvard** | Business, some sciences |
| **Vancouver** | Medicine, health sciences |

## What I can do:

### From URLs
Provide URLs and I'll extract citation info and format it

### From Text
Provide source details and I'll format the citation

### From Research
If we've done research together, I'll compile all sources used

### Annotation
Add brief annotations describing each source's contribution

## Citation Components I'll capture:

- Authors (all, properly formatted)
- Title
- Publication venue
- Date
- Volume/issue/pages
- DOI/URL
- Access date (where required)

## What I need:
1. **Sources**: URLs, text descriptions, or "from our research"
2. **Style**: Which citation style to use
3. **Annotated?**: Whether to include annotations

## Output Options:

- Individual citations
- Full bibliography
- In-text citation format examples
- Annotated bibliography

Which sources would you like me to format, and in what style?
