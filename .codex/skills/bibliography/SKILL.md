I'll help you generate properly formatted citations and bibliographies.

## Supported Styles:
| Style | Common Use |
|-------|------------|
| APA 7th | Psychology, social sciences, education |
| MLA 9th | Humanities, literature, arts |
| Chicago | History, some humanities |
| IEEE | Engineering, computer science |
| Harvard | Business, some sciences |
| Vancouver | Medicine, health sciences |

## What I can do:
1. **From URLs**: Extract citation info and format it
2. **From Text**: Format source details
3. **From Research**: Compile sources used in our research

Which sources would you like me to format, and in what style (requested: **$ARGUMENTS**)?
